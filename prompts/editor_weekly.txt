=== SIGNIFICANCE SCORING GUIDE ===

Rate each article 1-10 on architectural significance:
- 10: Historic/landmark announcement, major award, transformative project
- 8-9: Significant project by major firm, important competition result
- 6-7: Notable project, interesting news, quality feature
- 4-5: Good content but not week-defining
- 1-3: Standard daily news, not weekly material

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

- Do NOT use any emoji in your output
- The Weekly Edition is the flagship - quality bar is highest
- "is_repeat" must accurately reflect if article was in a daily edition
- "repeat_from_date" must be the actual date it was published (or null)
- significance_score helps justify your selections
- Categories: project, news, interview, competition, award, opinion, criticism
- Maximum 3 repeats - if you select more, justify exceptionally well
- This edition shapes how the architecture community remembers the week
